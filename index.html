                <h1>About Dem Pigeons</h1>
                <p>Pigeonhole LLC fatefully began with a group of friends sitting around their favorite pub (or is it café?) tossing back pints and wines - you can probably guess who drinks which. The discussion was on the influx of film projects into West Virginia, more specifically the Eastern Panhandle, our home. We all are very passionate about WV and love that these productions are taking place here.</p>
                <p>Seeing the positive impact these productions have on the local economy, we wanted to get involved in supporting this mutually beneficial situation.  Given our team’s unique, but perfectly dove-tailed (pigeon-tailed?) set of skills, our initial focus was on helping production companies successfully take advantage of the lucrative incentives provided by the state.  Pigeonhole LLC will do everything to ensure your production gets the assistance and tailored services required to make the process of receiving your WV tax credits and incentives as seamless as possible.</p>
                <p>We believe in self starting entrepreneurial ventures, and that’s why we have started this project from the ground up with our own boot leather. No outside investors, no second mortgages, no credit card debt so we only answer to our customers.</p>
                <p>Among other offerings, we’re in the process of developing software which will also be of great use to the entertainment industry. But don’t ask us to let that cat out of the bag just yet! We’ll show you that when the time is right...</p>

                    With over 14 years experience as a software and web developer, Mark Everhart brings an amazing amount of knowledge and experience to Pigeonhole LLC.</br></br>

					After realizing that archaeology was more  backbreaking work than Indiana Jones style adventure, Mark decided to pursue his first passion - computers.  For the past 10 years Mark has managed his own technology services company, providing localization and desktop publishing support to multiple translation agencies and Fortune 500 companies.</br></br>

					In his spare time Mark is an avid beard enthusiast who has been growing his spectacular beard for over a year.  In addition to answering any technical questions you may have he will also educate you on the proper types of oil to use in your beard for maximum shine and length.</br></br>
					<h3>Matthew Druck</h3>
                    Experienced in a multitude of fields; Network Engineering, Professor of Mathematics, Restaurateur and, most recently, Accountant, Matthew is always about the numbers.  A city boy growing up in Northeast New Jersey, Matthew moved to Iowa to go to college and found he loves rural living and extreme weather.</br></br>

					After working for a few television productions in the Accounting Office, Matthew recognized the opportunity to eliminate a reliance on manual procedures.  While chatting over a few beers at the local pub with some friends, the team was formed!</br></br>
					<h3>Jay Lushbaugh</h3>
                    A true Jay of all trades, Jay Lushbaugh brings wide range of experiences to the table. From over a dozen years in the advertising industry to running the East Coast operations of a logistics and distribution company to following his own inner entrepreneurial spirit. Jay has tried to experience as much as possible both professionally and personally.</br></br>

					Jay started his fist business when he was just a small child with his cousin, a lemonade stand. Yeah we know that story, but the fact is this guy is all about the business, yours and his. As with the business he currently owns Jay can fix just about anything, and as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke” he can make it better.</br></br>
					<h3>Julie Druck</h3>
                    Julie started out in life with a passion for Electrical Engineering (like her father). After a year at university getting to know herself, she realized that Computer Science was a better fit. After a couple of twists and turns, motherhood included, she earned a degree and started a career in corporate technology. </br></br>

					Now with almost two decades experience behind her, Julie has designed and implemented numerous programs. By leveraging her training as a Six Sigma Black Belt and love of data analytics, she has driven diverse initiatives from the selection of vendors to managing expenses and saving millions of dollars. </br></br>

					When she isn’t looking for ways to save money and improve process, Julie drives her family a little crazy, stays out of the kitchen, manages her Multiple Dog Syndrome, reads, watches MMA, plays piano and drinks red wine. </br></br>
					<h3>Christie Ence</h3>
                    An effective technical communicator that excels in  simplifying complicated concepts through the creation of eye catching visual pieces and/or concise documentation.</br></br>
